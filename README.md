# ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS
## Built with Spring Boot, AngularJS, Bootstrap and Maven

This is an implementation of the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in Java. 
You can choose two different game modes:

1. Rock Paper Scissors:         The classic game mode.
2. Rock Paper Scissors Well:    The classic game mode plus "well", which wins against stone and scissors, but loses against paper.

### Try it out
To play the game you first have to clone the project into a local git repository.
Afterwards you can package it using the Maven command `mvn clean package`. 
To run it open a command line and cd into the /target directory of the project.
Execute `java -jar rockpaperscissors-X.X.X-SNAPSHOT.jar` (X.X.X is the version number).
Open a browser at localhost:8080 and you're ready to play against the computer!
